<p>Escape from Tarkov is a survival multiplayer game that has taken the gaming world by storm. The game is set in a city called Tarkov, where players must navigate their way through various maps to escape. One of the maps is the Lighthouse, which is known for its challenging terrain and tricky extracts. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide on how to extract from the Lighthouse map in Escape from Tarkov.</p>
<h2>The Lighthouse Map</h2>
<p>The Lighthouse map is located on the shoreline and is known for its unique terrain. The map is divided into two parts, the landmass and the water surrounding it. The landmass is a combination of rocky terrain, open fields, and buildings, while the water surrounding it is vast and has several islands.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of the Lighthouse map is that there are only two extracts available, which makes it difficult for players to escape. However, with the right strategy and knowledge of the map, players can successfully extract from the Lighthouse map.</p>
<h2>Extracts in the Lighthouse Map</h2>
<h3>Question: What are the extracts available in the Lighthouse map?</h3>
<p>There are two extracts available in the Lighthouse map:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lighthouse</li>
<li>The Pier Boat</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lighthouse extract is located on the top of the lighthouse, which is on the eastern side of the map. The Pier Boat extract is located on the western side of the map, near the pier.</p>
<h3>Question: How can players extract from the Lighthouse map?</h3>
<p>Players can extract from the Lighthouse map by making their way to either of the two extracts. However, the extracts are not always available, and players must be aware of the conditions required for the extracts to be active.</p>
<p>The Lighthouse extract is only available when the light on top of the lighthouse is on. Players must first turn on the generator located in the basement of the lighthouse to activate the light. Once the light is on, players can make their way to the top of the lighthouse to extract.</p>
<p>The Pier Boat extract is only available when the boat is present at the pier. Players must listen for the bell that rings when the boat arrives and make their way to the pier to extract.</p>
<h2>Tips for Extracting from the Lighthouse Map</h2>
<p>Extracting from the Lighthouse map can be challenging, but with the right strategy, players can successfully extract. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route: Before entering the map, plan your route to the extract points. This will help you avoid unnecessary encounters and increase your chances of survival.</li>
<li>Be aware of the time: The extracts are not always available, and players must be aware of the time required for the extracts to be active.</li>
<li>Listen for sounds: The bell that rings when the boat arrives at the pier can be heard from a distance. Players must listen for these sounds to know when to make their way to the pier.</li>
<li>Bring the right gear: The Lighthouse map has a challenging terrain, and players must bring the right gear, such as a backpack, armor, and weapons, to increase their chances of survival.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Lighthouse map in Escape from Tarkov is a challenging map that requires players to navigate their way through unique terrain and extract successfully. With the right strategy and knowledge of the map, players can successfully extract from the Lighthouse map. Remember to plan your route, be aware of the time, listen for sounds, and bring the right gear to increase your chances of survival.</p>
